### Hi, I'm Stuart Boynton ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a seocnd year Master's student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) studying Machine Learning and Data Science. I graduated from UCSD majoring in Computer Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± This past Summer I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for a Digital Design Project course at UCSD. Thios covers the basics of SystemVerilog and by the end of the course students design projects such as a SHA256, a Bitcoin mining model and an Asynchronous FIFO. I have also been working with a PhD student researching efficient compilation of Graph Neural Networks.Over the Summer of 2022 I worked as a data engineer intern at Boingo Wireless and I learnt a lot about how a data ingestion pipeline can work and how to make that data useful for everyone in the company. Between January and September 2021 I researched ways to control Autonomous Vehicles to control traffic in order to reduce stop-and-go traffic waves. Some of this work can be found in the smoothing-traffic-flow repository.
