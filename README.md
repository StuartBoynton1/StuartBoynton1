### Hi, I'm Stuart Boynton ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a first year Master's student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) studying Machine Learning and Data Science. I graduated from UCSD majoring in Computer Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently searching for internship opportunities for June-September 2023. Over this past summer (2022) I worked as a data engineer intern at Boingo Wireless and I learnt a lot about how a data ingestion pipeline can work and how to make that data useful for everyone in the company. Between January and September 2021 I researched ways to control Autonomous Vehicles to control traffic in order to reduce stop-and-go traffic waves. Some of this work can be found in the smoothing-traffic-flow repository.

- âš¡ Quick facts: I was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa. I am the Captain on the UCSD Division one Men's Rowing program.
