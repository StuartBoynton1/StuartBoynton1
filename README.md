### Hi I'm Stuart Boynton ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a final year student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) studying Computer Engineering. I am planning on doing a Masters degree at UCSD in Machine Learning and Data Science starting September 2022.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently searching for internship opportunities for June-September 2022. Between January and September 2021 I researched ways to control Autonomous Vehicles to control traffic in order to reduce stop-and-go traffic waves. Some of this work can be found in the smoothing-traffic-flow repository.
